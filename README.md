# Global Pause

Note from the creator:
I am not updating this mod. Use at your own risk.
The source is available. Feel free to modify it to get it to work again. I will upload it and credit you :D.

Add the option to pause the game from the start menu.

Features:
- Pause from the start menu (admin only)
- Vote to pause from the start menu (everyone else, not yet implemented)
- Hotkey to toggle pause (default "P", default disabled, admin only)
- Pause when map is open (default disabled, singleplayer only)
- Pause when console is open (default disabled, singleplayer only)

Known bugs:
- When joining a server that is "paused" youll be stuck at the connecting screen, I cannot do anything to fix this.

Future improvements:
Useful for multi player:
- vote to (un)pause, which allows servers without an admin present to pause(and unpause) the game.
Useful for single player:
- Option for AutoPause/AutoUnPause on crafting/inventory

Multiplayer pausing should now work (changed logic for this work).

Also, for some reason, now the animations stop when you pause. that means that animals won't keep moving after you pause.
I have no idea what fixed this...
