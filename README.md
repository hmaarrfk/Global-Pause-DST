 # Global Pause
Note from the creator:
Mod creator: I am not updating this mod. Use at your own risk.
The source is available. Feel free to modify it to get it to work again. I will upload it and credit you :D.

Add the option to pause the game from the start menu.

Features:
- Pause from the start menu (admin only)
- Vote to pause from the start menu (everyone else, not yet implemented)
- Hotkey to toggle pause (default "P", default disabled, admin only)
- Pause when map is open (default disabled, singleplayer only)
- Pause when console is open (default disabled, singleplayer only)

When joining a server that is "paused" youll be stuck at the connecting screen, I cannot do anything to fix this.

Known bugs:
- I don't know what happens if a player joins and the game is paused.

Future improvements:
Useful for multi player:
- vote to (un)pause, which allows servers without an admin present to pause(and unpause) the game.
Useful for single player:
- Option for AutoPause/AutoUnPause on crafting/inventory

Added a proper icon in the game mod list.

v1.2.0 changes
Multiplayer pausing should now work (changed logic for this work).
The ClientHost now only SetTimeScale(0) after everybody else has.

Also, for some reason, now the animations stop when you pause. that means that animals won't keep moving after you pause.
I have no idea what fixed this...
